# Ship_Battlefield 
"Battleship" is a game for two participants, in which the players take turns hitting the coordinates on the opponent's map.
If the enemy with these coordinates has a "ship", then the ship or its deck is killed.
The goal of the player is to be the first to kill all the game "ships" of the enemy.
